Mother Nature is the ultimate inspiration. When you're feeling sluggish, simply walking outside and getting fresh air can do wonders for your mood and outlook. Often, nature's beauty can take your breath (and words) away. 

"Nature is not a place to visit, it is home." Gary Snyder

"In every walk with nature one receives far more than he seeks." John Muir

"What is the good of your stars and trees, your sunrise and the wind, if they do not enter into our daily lives?" E.M. Forster

## Ants

Ants play an important role in the environment. Ants turn and aerate the soil, allowing water and oxygen to reach plant roots. Ants take seeds down into their tunnel to eat the nutritious elaiosomes that are part of the seed.
